A Day Trip Conversation
Going to the Zoo
GREG:  "Hey Steve.  My family and I want to do something fun this weekend?  Do you have any suggestions?"<br />STEVE:  "The weather is going to be nice.  You should do something outdoors."<br />GREG:  "Yeah, it's supposed to be sunny all weekend."<br />STEVE:  "How about a picnic at the park?"<br />GREG:  "We do that often.  I want to do something more fun."<br />STEVE:  "How about the city zoo?  I heard that bear cubs were recently born there."<br />GREG:  "That's a good idea.  We haven't been to the zoo in a long time."<br />STEVE:  "Then you should definitely go this weekend."<br />GREG:  "The last time we were there, it started raining.  None of the animals wanted to come out."<br />STEVE:  "That must've been boring."<br />GREG:  "It was boring.  The kids wanted to go home early."<br />STEVE:  "The animals should be more visible since the weather is going to be sunny this weekend."<br />GREG:  "Yeah.  I think we will go to the zoo.  Hopefully, this time it'll be more fun."<br />STEVE:  "Actually, I have four tickets to the zoo.  You can have them.  Our family won't be able to go.  The tickets expire this weekend."<br />GREG:  "Thanks, Steve!  Let me pay you for them.  Zoo tickets are expensive."<br />STEVE:  "Don't worry about it.  It's my gift to you since your last visit was not fun."<br />GREG:  "Are you sure!  This is very generous of you."<br />STEVE:  "Also, you mowed my lawn a few times after I had back surgery last year.  I really appreciated that."<br />GREG:  "I'm glad we're neighbors."<br />

Going to the Beach
SALLY:  "Carl.  Are you going to watch television all day?"<br />CARL:  "No.  Is there something you want to do?"<br />SALLY:  "It's a beautiful day.  The sun is shining.  We should do something outdoors."<br />CARL:  "Ok.  What should we do?"<br />SALLY:  "Let's go to the beach."<br />CARL:  "OK.  I'll grab the beach chairs and towels."<br />SALLY:  "Great!  I'll pack some snacks and drinks.  Don't forget the sunscreen."<br />CARL:  "Where is it?"<br />SALLY:  "It's in the bathroom cabinet."<br />CARL:  "Is there anything else we need to bring?"<br />SALLY:  "I'll bring the camera.  I want to take pictures of the sunset."<br />CARL:  "Good idea!  The sunset is beautiful at the beach."<br />SALLY:  "Do you remember the last time we went to the beach?"<br />CARL:  "No.  It's been a long time.  Why don't we go more often?"<br />SALLY:  "Because you're always watching TV."<br />CARL:  "Ok.  Let's go to the beach when the weather is nice and watch TV when it rains."<br />SALLY:  "That's a deal!"<br />

Going to the Amusement Park
NANCY:  "Hi Sheila.  Have you been to the new amusement park yet?"<br />SHEILA:  "No.  When did it open?"<br />NANCY:  "Last weekend."<br />SHEILA:  "Was it crowded?"<br />NANCY:  "It was very crowded.  Parking is terrible too."<br />SHEILA:  "Did you have fun?"<br />NANCY:  "Oh yes!  The roller coasters are really fun.  My kids had a great time.  It was even fun for the adults too."<br />SHEILA:  "I didn't know it was open yet.  I will have to take my son soon."<br />NANCY:  "You should.  They will love it."<br />SHEILA:  "Are the tickets expensive?"<br />NANCY:  "Yeah, they're pretty expensive.  But your family will enjoy it."<br />SHEILA:  "Maybe we'll go this weekend.  We don't have any plans on Saturday.  My son has been asking about it."<br />NANCY:  "If you go on Saturday, try to go early.  There aren't enough parking spots.  They need to add more."<br />SHEILA:  "Ok.  That's good to know.  Do you have any other tips?"<br />NANCY:  "The lines for the rides are very long, so be patient."<br />SHEILA:  "Ok.  I assumed that.  Now I have to convince my husband to go."<br />NANCY:  "He doesn't like amusement parks?"<br />SHEILA:  "No.  I have motion sickness, so I can't ride any of the roller coasters.  That means my husband has to ride all of them with our son."<br />NANCY:  "Tell him to be prepared.  There are a lot of roller coasters."<br />

Now, I can take you."<br />TIMOTHY:  "I can't wait!"<br />DAD:  "You also need a life jacket."<br />TIMOTHY:  "Why?"<br />DAD:  "You should always wear a life jacket if you're going in a boat."<br />TIMOTHY:  "Ok, dad."<br />DAD:  "Now let's go to the fishing store and buy some bait."<br />TIMOTHY:  "What's bait?"<br />DAD:  "Things that will attract the fish to the hook."<br />TIMOTHY:  "Like worms?"<br />DAD:  "Exactly!"<br />TIMOTHY:  "This is going to be so much fun!"<br />

I don't want to move boxes and furniture in the rain."<br />PHIL:  "That's true.  When are you going to be done?"<br />JAMES:  "I don't know.  He has a lot of stuff.  It could be all day."<br />PHIL:  "Well, if you get done early, why don't you meet us at the lake?"<br />JAMES:  "Are you going out on a boat?"<br />PHIL:  "No, we're going to fish on the lake shore.  None of us have a boat."<br />JAMES:  "My brother has a boat.  I can ask him if we can borrow it sometime."<br />PHIL:  "That would be awesome!  Thanks!"<br />JAMES:  "Well, I'm going to head home now.  I'm tired."<br />PHIL:  "Yeah.  Me too.  Call me this weekend if you get done early."<br />

Just wait."<br />JOHN:  "The sun is starting to set and I'm tired of being out here."<br />STEVE:  "At least it didn't rain today.  We had clear skies all day."<br />JOHN:  "That's true.  It was nice today.  Hey, can you hold my fishing pole?  I need to go to the restroom."<br />STEVE:  "Sure.  Wait, John!"<br />JOHN:  "Steve, what?"<br />STEVE:  "Something is pulling on your fishing pole!  Here, grab it!"<br />JOHN:  "Wow!  That's a huge salmon!"<br />STEVE:  "I told you to be patient and you would catch something."<br />JOHN:  "Now I can take home dinner.  Want to come over and have salmon with us?"<br />

THOMAS:  "How was the hotel?"<br />SAM:  "It was awful.  We had to switch rooms a couple of times."<br />THOMAS:  "Why?"<br />SAM:  "Well, we found bugs in the carpet in one room.  We had already unpacked.  So, we had to re-pack everything and ask for another room."<br />THOMAS:  "What was wrong with the second room?"<br />SAM:  "We paid for a garden room and it was a view of the parking lot."<br />THOMAS:  "That's terrible.  Did you finally get a good room?"<br />SAM:  "They were out of garden view rooms, so they upgraded us to an ocean view room."<br />THOMAS:  "That's nice!  So, why was it awful?"<br />SAM:  "Our next door neighbor snored so loudly.  He kept us awake every night."<br />THOMAS:  "Did you ask for another room?"<br />SAM:  "Yes, but they said that there were no more rooms available."<br />THOMAS:  "I'm sorry you had a terrible time."<br />SAM:  "That's ok.  The manager was really nice about it.  He offered us a free stay next time."<br />THOMAS:  "Are you going to go back there?"<br />SAM:  "Of course.  It'll be free."<br />

What are we making?"<br />MOM:  "Pancakes, eggs, bacon, and hash browns."<br />LUCY:  "Yummy!  That sounds delicious."<br />MOM:  "I hope so.  Your grandfather has a big appetite.  I hope there's enough food."<br />LUCY:  "Mom, you always make too much food.  It looks like a breakfast buffet every time they come over."<br />MOM:  "I want to make sure there is enough food. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day."<br />LUCY:  "Should I make freshly-squeezed orange juice?"<br />MOM:  "That would be great.  Do you know where the juicer is?"<br />LUCY:  "Yeah, it's on the top shelf of the pantry."<br />MOM:  "Oh no!"<br />LUCY:  "What's wrong, Mom?"<br />MOM:  "I'm out of eggs.  Tell your Dad to go to the store and buy some eggs.  I'll start on the bacon and hash browns."<br />LUCY:  "Dad!  Mom needs you to buy some eggs!"<br />

I hear they have really good food especially their omelets."<br />JANE:  "Susan went their last weekend and said it was the best breakfast place in town."<br />KEVIN:  "Yeah, I heard the same thing from Janet.  She waited an hour for a table."<br />JANE:  "I don't think I can wait an hour.  I'm hungry right now."<br />KEVIN:  "Do you want to make breakfast at home?"<br />JANE:  "Ok.  What do you want to eat?"<br />KEVIN:  "I'd like a ham and cheese omelet."<br />JANE:  "That sounds good.  Do we have all of the ingredients?"<br />KEVIN:  "Well, we only need eggs, ham, and cheese."<br />JANE:  "I think we may be out of ham.  I used the last few slices for a sandwich yesterday."<br />KEVIN:  "Ok.  How about a vegetable omelet?"<br />JANE:  "That's good too.  We have green peppers, mushrooms, and onions."<br />KEVIN:  "That's perfect."<br />JANE:  "Great!  I'll brew some coffee and you make the omelet."<br />KEVIN:  "I don't know how to make an omelet."<br />JANE:  "You don't?  Well, I don't either."<br />KEVIN:  "Let's just go to the new diner."<br />JANE:  "That sounds like a better plan."<br />

I'm getting hungry now."<br />SALLY:  "Me too."<br />MARY:  "Would you like to join us on Saturday morning?"<br />SALLY:  "I can't on Saturday.  Joanne has a soccer game in the morning.

What are you making?"<br />SUE:  "I don't know.  His wife is a vegetarian, so I need to make one dish without meat."<br />ALICE:  "My mother-in-law is a vegetarian.

You're a great cook."<br />SUE:  "I've never cooked for Jeff's boss before.  I want to make sure everything is perfect."<br />ALICE:  "I understand.  I cooked for my boss once.  It was a disaster.  I burned the roast beef."<br />SUE:  "Oh no!  What happened?"<br />ALICE:  "I was too busy talking and forgot to take it out of the oven.  We all laughed, but I was so embarrassed."<br />SUE:  "I'll make sure to use a timer."<br />ALICE:  "Great idea!"<br />SUE:  "I think I will make lasagna."<br />ALICE:  "Your lasagna is delicious.  My mother-in-law makes great vegetarian lasagna.  I'll call her right now."<br />SUE:  "Thank you so much!  I'll go the market after you talk to her."<br />ALICE:  "Good luck tonight."<br />

I was thinking about applying at a fast food restaurant."<br />SAM:  "It's a good place to learn how to work quickly."<br />SCOTT:  "I'm a fast learner and I can move pretty quickly."<br />SAM:  "Also, it's a good place to learn how to handle customers."<br />SCOTT:  "I don't have any customer service experience."<br />SAM:  "They will train you.  You just have to be polite and listen well."<br />SCOTT:  "I can do that."<br />SAM:  "You should apply then."<br />SCOTT:  "Did you get to eat a lot of the food?"<br />SAM:  "I ate too much fast food working there.

Talking about your Lunch
BOBBY:  "Hey Steve, what did your mom pack you for lunch today?"<br />STEVE:  "Hey Bobby.  She packs me the same lunch every day.  A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cookies, and milk."<br />BOBBY:  "I got something new today.  It looks like a tuna sandwich.  I'm not sure I like it."<br />STEVE:  "I love tuna sandwiches.  Do you want to trade?"<br />BOBBY:  "Sure!  But will your mom get mad?"<br />STEVE:  "No.  She won't know.  I won't tell her."<br />BOBBY:  "Do you ever buy the school lunch?"<br />STEVE:  "No, it looks gross."<br />BOBBY:  "It's actually not bad.  Some dishes are pretty good."<br />STEVE:  "Which ones have you tried?"<br />BOBBY:  "The spaghetti and pizza are good.  But the hamburgers and burritos are terrible.  They taste like cardboard."<br />STEVE:  "That's awful!  Maybe I'll buy lunch when the cafeteria serves spaghetti and pizza.  Those are my favorite dishes at home."<br />BOBBY:  "They're pretty good, but not as good as our moms' cooking."<br />STEVE:  "Are you done with lunch?  Let's go out to recess."<br />BOBBY:  "Yeah.  Let's go!"<br />

She stormed off and I didn't get to explain what I meant."<br />JOE:  "I'm really curious now.  What did you say to her?"<br />BILL:  "I told her to exercise."<br />JOE:  "Well, that probably wasn't a smart thing to say to a woman."<br />BILL:  "I meant that she should exercise to stay healthy."<br />JOE:  "That sounds better.

Christine and I had a big argument and she has decided to move out."<br />BETTY:  "What did you argue about?"<br />NANCY:  "I told her that she needs to help clean up around the apartment."<br />BETTY:  "What happened after you told her that?"<br />NANCY:  "She got upset and said she is moving out.  But it's the truth.  She never helps around house."<br />BETTY:  "Yeah, that could be a problem."<br />NANCY:  "I had to say something since we're roommates and I'm tired of cleaning her mess."<br />BETTY:  "I totally understand.  I like things neat and organized too."<br />NANCY:  "But the bigger problem is that she never pays her rent on time.  She is late every month."<br />BETTY:  "What are you going to do?"<br />NANCY:  "I need to find a roommate soon.  I can't afford the rent by myself.  Do you know anyone looking for a roommate?"<br />BETTY:  "Yes, I do."<br />NANCY:  "Who?"<br />BETTY:  "Me."<br />NANCY:  "That would be awesome!"<br />

Why is she moving?"<br />SALLY:  "Her dad got a job in another state."<br />MOM:  "Where is she moving?"<br />SALLY:  "To California.  That's across the country."<br />MOM:  "There are many ways you can still keep in touch.  You can e-mail, text, and call each other on the phone."<br />SALLY:  "But it won't be the same as seeing each other every day.  She is my best friend.  I'm going to miss her."<br />MOM:  "I know you will.  When are they moving?"<br />SALLY:  "At the end of June when the school year ends.  In two months."<br />MOM:  "Would you like to invite her over this weekend?  You can have a sleepover."<br />SALLY:  "Yes, please.  That would be great.  We're going to try to hang out as much as possible before she moves."<br />MOM:  "That sounds like a good plan."<br />SALLY:  "Can we visit her in California?"<br />MOM:  "It's pretty far from us.  We don't know anyone there."<br />SALLY:  "Yes, we do.  Candace and her family."<br />

This is the first home your mother and I bought."<br />JEFF:  "Do you remember all of our holiday parties here?  Everyone came to our house."<br />DAD:  "Of course I remember them.  Those were the best times."<br />JEFF:  "Now I'm married and have a family of my own."<br />DAD:  "I wish we didn't have to sell it, but we can no longer take care of it.  We're getting old and it's too much work."<br />JEFF:  "Do you know who bought our house?"<br />DAD:  "A young couple with two kids.  They seem like a loving family."<br />JEFF:  "Where will you and mom go?"<br />DAD:  "We found a beautiful, small condo a few blocks away."<br />JEFF:  "That's nice.  Will there be enough room when the grandchildren visit?"<br />DAD:  "Yes.  We have an extra room for guests, so your kids can stay over any time."<br />JEFF:  "Where's Mom?"<br />DAD:  "She's at the fabric store.  She wants to sew new curtains for the condo."<br />

Neighbors Conversation
Loud Dog Barking
KATHY:  "Hi Carol.  You look tired today."<br />CAROL:  "I am tired.  I didn't get any sleep last night."<br />KATHY:  "Why?"<br />CAROL:  "Our neighbor's dog would not stop barking.  He barked all night long."<br />KATHY:  "That's awful!  Did you complain to your neighbor?"<br />CAROL:  "I knocked on his door, but he didn't answer.  I don't think he was home."<br />KATHY:  "What did you do all night?"<br />CAROL:  "I couldn't sleep, so I tried to read a book.  But the dog's barking kept distracting me.  So, I just watched TV."<br />KATHY:  "I would be so angry.  You should've called the police."<br />CAROL:  "I didn't want to bother the police with a barking dog."<br />KATHY:  "I would have called them.  What if there was an emergency at your neighbor's house and the dog was trying to alert someone."<br />CAROL:  "That's true.  I didn't think about that.  But this dog usually barks because he's bored."<br />KATHY:  "That's annoying."<br />CAROL:  "I know."<br />KATHY:  "Hey Carol.  Is that your neighbor?  He's walking towards us."<br />CAROL:  "What is he holding?"<br />KATHY:  "It looks like a plate of cookies."<br />

What happened?"<br />HELEN:  "Our neighbors' children threw a big party last night.  The music was so loud."<br />JOAN:  "Wow!  Where were their parents?"<br />HELEN:  "They are on vacation.  They left the kids home."<br />JOAN:  "How old are the kids?"<br />HELEN:  "They're teenagers.  They're old enough to be home alone."<br />JOAN:  "Did you complain to them?"<br />HELEN:  "Yes!  I went over there three times.  I told them that their music was too loud and we were trying to sleep."<br />JOAN:  "What did they do?"<br />HELEN:  "Nothing.  They wouldn't turn the music down."<br />JOAN:  "That is so rude!  Why didn't you call the police?"<br />HELEN:  "I finally did.  The police found some of the teens drinking alcohol."<br />JOAN:  "I bet that ended the party."<br />HELEN:  "Yeah.  Now my neighbors are heading back home from their vacation."<br />JOAN:  "Do they know what happened?"<br />HELEN:  "Yes.  They are not happy.  Those kids are in big trouble."<br />

What is she going to do now?"<br />SARAH:  "I don't know.  Does she have any children?"<br />JANET:  "No, I don't think they had any children."<br />SARAH:  "How about other family members?"<br />JANET:  "I think she had one sister, but she passed away several years ago."<br />SARAH:  "So, she's all alone now?"<br />JANET:  "Yeah.  Isn't that sad?"<br />SARAH:  "Yes, it is very sad."<br />JANET:  "She is always so nice to everyone.  I think we should all get together and do something nice for her."<br />SARAH:  "I like that idea.  What should we do?"<br />JANET:  "Let's take turns helping her around the house?"<br />SARAH:  "Great idea!  We can take care of her yard, help clean her house, and bring her meals."<br />JANET:  "I love this.  Let's talk to the other neighbors soon."<br />

Only a couple of times a week."<br />TOM:  "Well, I think the bus is late today because of the rain."<br />ALICE:  "Oh.  Does the weather make a difference?"<br />TOM:  "Yes.  The bus is usually several minutes late when it rains."<br />ALICE:  "Because of bad traffic?"<br />TOM:  "Yeah and probably because of car accidents."<br />ALICE:  "That makes sense.  I must have picked the wrong day to ride the bus."<br />TOM:  "Actually, I think riding the bus on rainy days is better."<br />ALICE:  "Why?"<br />TOM:  "Then you don't have to drive in bad traffic.  Someone is driving for you."<br />ALICE:  "You are totally right!  I'm going to check the weather from now on.  I'm going to take the bus when it rains."<br />TOM:  "Then I'll see you here at the bus stop."<br />ALICE:  "Great!  It was nice talking with you."<br />TOM:  "Yes, it was.  I think our bus is coming now."<br />

Is it a cold?"<br />SUE:  "Yeah, I think so.  He has a cough and a sore throat."<br />LINDA:  "My son, Billy, was sick last week too.  He missed four days of school."<br />SUE:  "Wow!  I hope David isn't sick that long."<br />LINDA:  "There's a virus going around.  We need to stay healthy too."<br />SUE:  "I know.  I've been taking extra Vitamin C to stay healthy."<br />LINDA:  "Good idea!  I think I'll buy some today.  Do you need anything at the store?"<br />SUE:  "Actually, I do.  I couldn't go to the store because I didn't want to leave David alone."<br />LINDA:  "I understand.  What do you need?"<br />SUE:  "Could you please buy me a whole chicken?   I want to make David some chicken soup."<br />LINDA:  "That's a great idea!  I'll drop it off on my way home."<br />SUE:  "Thank you so much!  I will pay you back when you drop off the chicken."<br />LINDA:  "Ok!  I'm going to go to the store after lunch.  I will be at your house around 2 pm."<br />SUE:  "Great!  See you then.  Don't forget to buy Vitamin C!"<br />

I have a question about the flu shot."<br />SUE:  "What is it?"<br />LINDA:  "Are your kids getting the flu shot this year?"<br />SUE:  "They already did."<br />LINDA:  "They did?"<br />SUE:  "Yeah.  We went to the doctor's office last week.  They both got them."<br />LINDA:  "What about you?"<br />SUE:  "I got one too.  So did Jeff."<br />LINDA:  "Really?  Bill won't get one."<br />SUE:  "Why?"<br />LINDA:  "He says he never gets sick."<br />SUE:  "Well, that could be true.  But we don't want to risk it this year."<br />LINDA:  "I completely understand that."<br />SUE:  "Both of my kids got really sick last year.  I just want to give them extra protection just in case."<br />LINDA:  "Yeah.  I think I'm going to make an appointment for all of us."<br />SUE:  "Even Bill?"<br />LINDA:  "No.  He won't go.  He'll just cancel his appointment."<br />SUE:  "Well, at least the three of you will be protected."<br />LINDA:  "That's true.  Ok, I better call the doctor's office now."<br />

Spring Cleaning
SHARON:  "Hi Jill.  What are you doing today?"<br />JILL:  "Hi Sharon.  Today we are doing our annual spring cleaning."<br />SHARON:  "What is that?"<br />JILL:  "It's the day we thoroughly clean the whole house.  We throw away things we don't need, pack up things to donate, clean all of the rooms, and wash all of the windows."<br />SHARON:  "Wow!  That's a lot to do."<br />JILL:  "Yeah.  It takes all day."<br />SHARON:  "Do your kids help too."<br />JILL:  "Of course.  They look through their closets and toy bins to find clothes and toys to donate or throw away."<br />SHARON:  "That's a great idea!  But why is it called spring cleaning?"<br />JILL:  "Because it's done in the spring season."<br />SHARON:  "I see.  I think we're going to start doing this too.  Our house is so cluttered."<br />JILL:  "After we have the things ready for donation, Jim takes them to the local homeless shelter.  This makes the house easier to clean."<br />SHARON:  "That's great!  I'm going to tell my family about this."<br />JILL:  "Well, I better get started.  I have a lot to do.  Talk to you later, Sharon."<br />SHARON:  "Bye, Jill.  Thanks for the cleaning tip."<br />

My mom is very clean and organized too."<br />SALLY:  "I should've started a few days ago, but I was so busy at work."<br />KAREN:  "Why doesn't your husband help you?"<br />SALLY:  "He did help me.  He mowed the lawn, cleaned all of the bathrooms, and set up the guest room yesterday."<br />KAREN:  "Wow!  He did a lot too."<br />SALLY:  "I also have to go grocery shopping."<br />KAREN:  "What a busy day!  Do you need any help?"<br />SALLY:  "No, that's ok."<br />KAREN:  "I'm not busy today.  I can help you."<br />SALLY:  "Really?  Could you go grocery shopping for me?  I already made my shopping list."<br />KAREN:  "Of course!  You can pay me back when I drop off the groceries."<br />SALLY:  "Thank you so much!  I really appreciate it."<br />KAREN:  "That's what friends and neighbors are for."<br />

Thanks."<br />TED:  "Are you moving?"<br />GARY:  "No.  I need to clean out my attic today.  It's getting full up there."<br />TED:  "That's a big chore."<br />GARY:  "I know.  I don't even remember what's in there anymore."<br />TED:  "Well, if you don't know what's in there, you probably don't need it."<br />GARY:  "That's what my wife said."<br />TED:  "I had to clean out my attic last month and my wife said the same thing to me."<br />GARY:  "They must be talking to each other."<br />TED:  "What are you going to do with all the stuff?"<br />GARY:  "I think I'm going to have a garage sale next weekend.  What did you do with all of your stuff?"<br />TED:  "I threw half of it away and donated the other half."<br />GARY:  "That's a good idea.  Maybe I'll donate the things I don't need."<br />TED:  "What about the garage sale?"<br />GARY:  "That's just going to be another chore to do.  I'd rather go golfing."<br />TED:  "Good thinking!"<br />

First, let's start with cleaning up the playroom when it gets messy."<br />GREG:  "Ok.  What else?"<br />DAD:  "How about setting and clearing the dinner table."<br />GREG:  "These are easy."<br />DAD:  "And, loading and unloading the dishwasher."<br />GREG:  "Ok.  Do I have to do all of these things every day?"<br />DAD:  "No.  I want you to share these chores with your sister.  You can both decide which ones you want to do."<br />GREG:  "That's not fair."<br />DAD:  "Why isn't this fair?"<br />GREG:  "She's going to pick the easiest ones for herself and give me the harder chores to do."<br />DAD:  "No, she won't."<br />GREG:  "You don't know Susie.  I think I want a raise in my allowance."<br />DAD:  "We haven't told you how much you're getting yet."<br />GREG:  "If I have to share chores with my sister, I'm going to be doing most of the work."<br />

My daughter is so upset right now."<br />MARK:  "Have you called the local dog shelters?"<br />PHIL:  "Yeah, they haven't seen him.

He's wearing his dog tag and he's also microchipped."<br />MARK:  "That's good.  Should we make some flyers to post around the neighborhood?"<br />PHIL:  "My wife is doing that right now."<br />MARK:  "How old is Rusty?"<br />PHIL:  "He's four years old and he's brown with white spots."<br />MARK:  "I know what he looks like."<br />PHIL:  "Oh, that's right.  I'm not thinking straight.  I'm just worried he was stolen or is injured somewhere."<br />MARK:  "I understand.  He's part of your family."<br />PHIL:  "Yeah, he's a big part of our family.  We got him when he was a little puppy."<br />MARK:  "Hey Phil!  There he is!"<br />PHIL:  "Rusty!  Come here, boy!"<br />

I promise to help take care of it."<br />DAD:  "You have to walk him, feed him, bathe him, clean his messes, and play with him."<br />DANIEL:  "I promise to do all of those things."<br />DAD:  "I need to talk to your mom first."<br />DANIEL:  "But mom doesn't want a dog.  She doesn't like them."<br />DAD:  "It's because she is afraid of them."<br />DANIEL:  "Why is she afraid of dogs?"<br />DAD:  "She was bitten by a dog when she was a child."<br />DANIEL:  "Oh, I see.  But if we get a puppy, we can train it not to bite."<br />DAD:  "That's true."<br />DANIEL:  "Dad, did you have a dog when you were a kid?"<br />DAD:  "Yes.  But I was old enough to help take care of him."<br />DANIEL:  "How old were you?"<br />DAD:  "Ten years old."<br />DANIEL:  "Dad, I'm eleven years old."<br />

You love Buster."<br />JANET:  "I know.  But we just discovered that our son is allergic to dogs."<br />ALICE:  "Really?"<br />JANET:  "Yeah, he sneezes and gets a rash every time he pets him."<br />ALICE:  "That's terrible."<br />JANET:  "When Steven was a baby, we didn't know he was allergic.  But now he's crawling around and playing with Buster.  His symptoms get really bad."<br />ALICE:  "I'm so sorry to hear that.  You and Charlie have had Buster since he was a puppy.  I remember when all three of you moved in next door."<br />JANET:  "I know.  We got Buster before our son was born.  Charlie is so sad."<br />ALICE:  "How about your relatives?  Are there any family members that could take Buster?  Then you can still see him whenever you want."<br />JANET:  "I asked my sister and Charlie asked his brothers.  But no one is able to take a dog right now."<br />ALICE:  "Well, our kids are all grown up and living on their own.  Stan and I get lonely sometimes.  Would you like us to adopt Buster?"<br />JANET:  "Really?  You would do that?"<br />ALICE:  "Stan and I really like Buster.  He's housetrained and well-behaved.  He rarely barks too."<br />JANET:  "Don't you need to talk to Stan first!"<br />ALICE:  "Oh, he'll say yes.  He's been talking about getting a dog lately.  He'll be happy it's Buster."<br />JANET:  "Thank you so much!"<br />ALICE:  "You can come see him anytime."<br />JANET:  "You're the best neighbor anyone could have."<br />

How about renting a movie and watching it at home after the pizza place?"<br />ANNE:  "I love that idea!  Then they can play in our backyard if it doesn't rain."<br />CAROL:  "That sounds like a great party."<br />ANNE:  "Thanks for your help."<br />

He broke both of his legs and ribs.  He also has a head injury."<br />JOAN:  "That's terrible.  I had the flu, so I haven't seen or talked to anyone lately.  How's Judy?"<br />CAROL:  "Judy has come home a couple of times to get a change of clothes."<br />JOAN:  "She must be devastated."<br />CAROL:  "She is a very worried wife."<br />JOAN:  "Have you seen him?"<br />CAROL:  "Bob and I visited him in the hospital a couple of days ago.  He is on so much medication."<br />JOAN:  "Wow!  That's serious."<br />CAROL:  "Yeah."<br />JOAN:  "Does Judy know how long he's going to be in the hospital?"<br />CAROL:  "The doctors told her he may be there for several months."<br />JOAN:  "Oh my goodness.  What is she going to do?"<br />CAROL:  "Their children are helping her right now.  They're taking turns staying at the hospital."<br />JOAN:  "That's good.  I better visit him soon.  Thanks for the information."<br />

Talking about Stitches
ANNE:  "Hi Kate. Why do you look so tired?"<br />KATE:  "Oh hi Anne.  We just got back from the emergency room."<br />ANNE:  "Why?  What happened?"<br />KATE:  "Jason had to get stitches."<br />ANNE:  "Why?  Did he cut himself?"<br />KATE:  "Yeah, he was slicing some onions and the knife slipped.  He got a really deep cut on his finger."<br />ANNE:  "That sounds painful."<br />KATE:  "The painful part was waiting at the emergency room.  There was only one doctor working tonight.  We waited three hours."<br />ANNE:  "What about his finger?"<br />KATE:  "The nurse wrapped it with a bandage to stop the bleeding."<br />ANNE:  "I hate the ER.  It is always crowded and takes too long."<br />KATE:  "I know.   But, I knew he had to have stitches.  It was a really bad cut, so we had to stay."<br />ANNE:  "How many stitches did he get?"<br />KATE:  "Nine.  He won't be able to play video games for a few weeks."<br />ANNE:  "Is that a good thing?"<br />KATE:  "Actually, it is.  But he's not happy about it."<br />

Auto Accident Conversation
Small Auto Accident
JANE:  "Hi Carol.  Did you get a new car?"<br />CAROL:  "Hi Jane.  No, this is a rental car.  I was in an auto accident yesterday."<br />JANE:  "Are you ok?"<br />CAROL:  "Yeah.  My back hurts a little, but luckily I wasn't seriously injured."<br />JANE:  "Did you go to the hospital?"<br />CAROL:  "Yeah.  I went there this morning.  The doctor took some did x-rays.  Nothing is serious.  I just have some bruises."<br />JANE:  "I'm glad you are ok.  Was there another car involved?"<br />CAROL:  "Yeah, the other driver rear-ended me at a red light."<br />JANE:  "Wow!  Is he or she ok?"<br />CAROL:  "Yeah.  He seemed ok at the scene."<br />JANE:  "This could've been a serious accident."<br />CAROL:  "I know.  We were both lucky."<br />JANE:  "Where is your car?  Is it getting fixed?"<br />CAROL:  "No.  It's too damaged to be repaired.  It's at the junkyard now."<br />JANE:  "That's terrible.  Is your insurance going to pay for a new car?"<br />CAROL:  "Well, it was the other driver's fault, so his insurance is going to take care of it."<br />JANE:  "That's good.  Are you going to buy the same type of car?"<br />CAROL:  "I think so.  I loved that car.  It protected me in this accident."<br />

I just got back from the hospital."<br />ALICE:  "Is something wrong?"<br />MARY:  "My son was in an auto accident last night."<br />ALICE:  "Oh dear.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Was he seriously injured?"<br />MARY:  "Yes.  He broke both of his legs and his ribs."<br />ALICE:  "That's awful!"<br />MARY:  "I know.  He just got his driver's license a month ago."<br />ALICE:  "How scary for him."<br />MARY:  "It wasn't his fault though.  He was hit by a drunk driver."<br />ALICE:  "That's terrible!"<br />MARY:  "I'm so angry about it!  My son could've been killed by an irresponsible driver."<br />ALICE:  "You're right!  Did they catch the other driver?  Was he or she injured?"<br />MARY:  "Yeah, he was arrested.  He wasn't injured."<br />ALICE:  "Do you think he will go to jail?"<br />MARY:  "I don't know.  I'm just worried about my son right now."<br />ALICE:  "Can I help you with anything?"<br />MARY:  "Well, I just came home to get a change of clothes.  I'm going to go back to the hospital soon.

Freeway Auto Accident

We had to take a detour."<br />SUSAN:  "Was anyone hurt?"<br />PETER:  "I think so.  I saw two ambulances and a fire truck driving by."<br />SUSAN:  "That's terrible."<br />PETER:  "I know.  I hope no one was seriously injured."<br />SUSAN:  "That's scary.  Do you know what caused the accident?"<br />PETER:  "I don't know.  I didn't see it happen."<br />SUSAN:  "You should've called me.  We were supposed to meet Cathy and Rick for dinner at 6 pm."<br />PETER:  "After seeing the accident, I didn't want to use my phone while driving."<br />SUSAN:  "That was smart."<br />PETER:  "We should just eat at home tonight.  I think traffic is going to be bad."<br />SUSAN:  "Oh no!"<br />PETER:  "What's wrong?"<br />SUSAN:  "I just got a text from Cathy.  She said she and Rick were in an accident on the freeway!  They're at the hospital."<br />PETER:  "Oh my goodness.  Let's go to the hospital now."<br />

Finding a Car Mechanic
JOE:  "Hey Stan.  Do you know any good mechanics around here?"<br />STAN:  "Yeah.  I use a really good one.  What's wrong with your car?"<br />JOE:  "I'm not sure.  I think there is a problem with my transmission."<br />STAN:  "Transmission problems can be very expensive."<br />JOE:  "I know.  I took it to an auto shop yesterday and it was so expensive.  I'm looking for someone cheaper, but who can also do a good job."<br />STAN:  "You should go to my mechanic.  You can trust him and his repair costs are pretty reasonable."<br />JOE:  "Is he close to us?"<br />STAN:  "Yeah.  His shop is just a few blocks away."<br />JOE:  "That's good.  I hope I don't have to replace the transmission.  That will be really expensive."<br />STAN:  "I know.  I had to replace the transmission on my old car.  The repair cost more than the price of the car."<br />JOE:  "That's crazy!  If my repair costs too much, I'm just going to buy a new car."<br />STAN:  "Can you afford a new car?"<br />JOE:  "No.  I would have to buy a used car."<br />STAN:  "Let me get my mechanic's phone number.  You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your car."<br />JOE:  "Thanks."<br />STAN:  "I can give you a ride home if you need to leave your car there."<br />JOE:  "If it's only a few blocks away, I'll walk.  If my car is too expensive to fix, I better get used to walking."<br />

Fixing the Car
JOHN:  "Hey Sam.  You're home?  Where's your car?"<br />SAM:  "Oh hey John.  It's in the auto shop."<br />JOHN:  "Again?  What's wrong with it this time?"<br />SAM:  "I'm not sure.  It's making a lot of strange noises."<br />JOHN:  "That's weird.  It's not even an old car."<br />SAM:  "I know.  I've only had it for three years.  My mechanic doesn't know what the problem is."<br />JOHN:  "He doesn't know?  What is he doing then?"<br />SAM:  "Trying all different things.  I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it."<br />JOHN:  "You should take it to another mechanic."<br />SAM:  "I should, but I already paid him.  He just keeps saying he will fix it."<br />JOHN:  "He doesn't sound very trustworthy."<br />SAM:  "I know.  I should've gone somewhere else.  But he was so cheap.  He was the cheapest I could find."<br />JOHN:  "Maybe too cheap isn't always better."<br />SAM:  "I'm learning that now."<br />JOHN:  "You should demand a refund."<br />SAM:  "I wish I could, but it's a little complicated."<br />JOHN:  "Why is it complicated?"<br />SAM:  "The mechanic is my brother-in-law."<br />

The car is getting repaired."<br />DAN:  "Are you ok?"<br />JASON:  "Yeah.  Luckily, it wasn't a serious accident.  There were just some minor damages to the fender and bumper."<br />DAN:  "That's good.  When do you get your car back?"<br />JASON:  "It's supposed to be ready this afternoon."<br />DAN:  "That's quick."<br />JASON:  "Yeah, my auto shop is pretty fast.  They have a lot of mechanics."<br />DAN:  "Do they do a good job?  Are they reasonably priced?"<br />JASON:  "Oh yes.  They do a great job.  I haven't had any problems yet.  They're a little more expensive than other places, but their work and service is excellent."<br />DAN:  "I may have to get their name and number.  My car needs some regular maintenance work."<br />JASON:  "They have a website.  Sometimes, they offer discounts on certain services."<br />DAN:  "Really?  That's good to know."<br />JASON:  "Yeah.  I'll e-mail you the website link."<br />DAN:  "Thanks.  I'll check it out tonight."<br />

Driving Conversation
Gas prices
MIKE:  "Hey Ben, have you seen the price of gas lately?"<br />BEN:  "Yeah Mike.  It's really high.  That's why I've been riding the bus to work."<br />MIKE:  "I wish I could ride the bus, but I would have to take three buses to get to work."<br />BEN:  "Three?"<br />MIKE:  "Yeah.  It would take me twice as long to get to work."<br />BEN:  "That's not good.  I only have to take one bus and it takes me directly from my home to my office building."<br />MIKE:  "You're lucky!"<br />BEN:  "I know.  What about riding your bike to work?"<br />MIKE:  "No, I'm not very good at cycling and it's too far."<br />BEN:  "You can carpool with someone."<br />MIKE:  "That's a good idea.  Then we could share the cost of gas and ride in the carpool lane."<br />BEN:  "Do you work with anyone who lives near you?"<br />MIKE:  "Yeah, my boss."<br />BEN:  "Would you want to ride with your boss?"<br />MIKE:  "No, not really.  I think I'd rather pay more for gas."<br />

Bad Traffic
KEVIN:  "The traffic is really getting bad these days."<br />JAMES:  "I agree.  I sat in traffic for two hours last night."<br />KEVIN:  "I've started to leave work late just to beat rush hour traffic."<br />JAMES:  "I wish I could do that.  I have to pick up my son before the daycare closes."<br />KEVIN:  "Oh, I see.  What time does the daycare close?"<br />JAMES:  "6 o'clock."<br />KEVIN:  "What time do you usually get there?"<br />JAMES:  "Just a few minutes before they close."<br />KEVIN:  "What happens if you're late?"<br />JAMES:  "They will wait with the child, of course.  But you have to pay extra."<br />KEVIN:  "Have you ever been late?"<br />JAMES:  "Yeah, a few times.  I was late yesterday.  I don't want to pay extra.  Daycare is already expensive."<br />KEVIN:  "Yeah, I'm sure it is.  Do you have other people who can help you?"<br />JAMES:  "No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad."<br />KEVIN:  "Is your boss understanding?"<br />JAMES:  "Yeah, she's very understanding.  She has children too."<br />

First, he has to show us that he is a responsible driver."<br />BILL:  "Did your auto insurance go up a lot?"<br />TOM:  "Yes!  Our insurance rate doubled."<br />BILL:  "Wow!  Are you serious?"<br />TOM:  "Yes, that's what makes me nervous.  I don't know how we'll be able to afford insurance when my younger son starts to drive."<br />BILL:  "When will that be?"<br />TOM:  "In two years."<br />BILL:  "Better start saving or better have your sons get part-time jobs."<br />TOM:  "I think I like the part-time job idea better."<br />

Is he excited about it?"<br />MARK:  "Not really.  He wants to spend it all on video games."<br />PETER:  "Well, it's his first paycheck, so I'm sure he wants to spend his own money."<br />MARK:  "I understand that.  He knows he can spend it any way he wants to.  I just want him to be able to learn how to save some too."<br />PETER:  "Yeah, I totally understand.  My first son spent his whole paycheck each time.  Now he doesn't have anything saved.  My second son saves and saves."<br />MARK:  "I'm hoping Jonathan saves and saves."<br />PETER:  "Now my older son always borrows money from his younger brother."<br />MARK:  "Wow!  Does your younger son loan him money?"<br />PETER:  "Yeah, but he adds on interest."<br />MARK:  "That's funny and smart.  He's like a bank."<br />PETER:  "He wants to be a banker one day."<br />MARK:  "This is giving him great experience."<br />PETER:  "Yeah, but not a great relationship with his brother."<br />

Yeah, I'm taking dancing classes and I need new dancing shoes."<br />CAROL:  "Where are the classes?"<br />JANE:  "At the local community center."<br />CAROL:  "How do you like it?"<br />JANE:  "I'm really enjoying it."<br />CAROL:  "What kind of dance are you learning?"<br />JANE:  "We're learning a few different types of dance.  So far, we have learned ballet, modern, and tap."<br />CAROL:  "Which one is your favorite?"<br />JANE:  "I like tap dance.  Ballet was pretty hard."<br />CAROL:  "Sounds like a lot of fun."<br />JANE:  "It is.  Do you want to join?  Our class is not full."<br />CAROL:  "I'm too old to take dance lessons."<br />JANE:  "No, you are not.  You should come to one of our classes.  The first visit is free."<br />CAROL:  "Really?  Free?  When are your lessons?"<br />JANE:  "Every Monday evening at 7 pm."<br />CAROL:  "OK.  I'll go next Monday.  But don't laugh at me.  I'm a terrible dancer."<br />JANE:  "Me too.

Halloween Conversation
What is Halloween?
SUE:  "Hello, Anne."<br />ANNE:  "Hi Sue."<br />SUE:  "Can you explain something to me?"<br />ANNE:  "Sure.  What is it?"<br />SUE:  "What is Halloween?"<br />ANNE:  "Oh.  It's a holiday that we celebrate once a year."<br />SUE:  "Is it the same date every year?"<br />ANNE:  "Yes.  It's on October 31."<br />SUE:  "What do people do on that day?"<br />ANNE:  "People dress up in costumes and go to other people's homes to collect candy."<br />SUE:  "Even strangers' homes?"<br />ANNE:  "Yes.  They knock on the doors and say 'Trick or Treat.'  Then the home owner gives out candy."<br />SUE:  "Do adults do it, too?"<br />ANNE:  "Not many adults.  It's usually just children."<br />SUE:  "Isn't that unsafe?"<br />ANNE:  "It can be.  But parents go with them."<br />SUE:  "I see.  My son wants to do it this year.  I didn't know what it was."<br />ANNE:  "You don't do this in your native country?"<br />SUE:  "No.  I guess it's a new tradition we have to learn."<br />ANNE:  "It's a lot of fun.  Your son will enjoy it."<br />

Trick-or-Treat
JAN:  "Hello?"<br />TINA:  "Hi Jan.  This is Tina.  Is Janice going trick-or-treating this year?"<br />JAN:  "I think so."<br />TINA:  "Cindy doesn't want to go?"<br />JAN:  "Why?"<br />TINA:  "She thinks it's for little kids."<br />JAN:  "That's funny.  She's only 9 years old."<br />TINA:  "I know.  She thinks it's for babies."<br />JAN:  "Tell her that babies cannot eat candy."<br />TINA:  "She said Halloween is boring."<br />JAN:  "What if she changes her mind after Halloween is over?  It's only once a year."<br />TINA:  "Then she has to wait another year."<br />JAN:  "Maybe Janice can talk to her."<br />TINA:  "Where are you and Janice going?"<br />JAN:  "Just around our neighborhood.  There are a lot of homes around here."<br />TINA:  "We live in an apartment.  Maybe that's why it's boring.  There aren't many kids here."<br />JAN:  "Bring Cindy here on Halloween.  We can all go together."<br />TINA:  "What a great idea!  Thanks!"<br />

What about Sally?"<br />CATHY:  "She can't decide between a bear and a lion."<br />JOAN:  "That's cute.  Are you going to make her costume?"<br />CATHY:  "No, not this year.  It's too much work.  How about you?"<br />JOAN:  "I'm lucky.  Amanda took ballet lessons last month, so she can wear her ballet outfit."<br />CATHY:  "That's smart."<br />JOAN:  "Yeah.  Costumes can be so expensive."<br />CATHY:  "I know.  That's why I made Sally's costume last year."<br />JOAN:  "What was she last year?  I can't remember."<br />CATHY:  "A butterfly."<br />JOAN:  "That's right.  She was so cute."<br />CATHY:  "Thanks.  This year, she wants to be an animal."<br />JOAN:  "That's not a bad idea.  It's going to be cold outside.  Her costume will keep her warm."<br />CATHY:  "True!  I better check out the costume store soon before everything is sold out."<br />JOAN:  "Or you may have to make her costume again."<br />

Then we light fireworks when it gets dark."<br />LEE:  "Oh, those loud and colorful explosions in the sky?"<br />JOHN:  "Yeah.  Would you like to come over and watch them with our family?"<br />LEE:  "Sure.  Can I bring my children, too?"<br />JOHN:  "Of course.  They will enjoy them.  But it is very dangerous, so we have to watch the kids carefully."<br />

Fourth of July

My family and I are going to the park to watch the fireworks."<br />JEFF:  "The park?"<br />BILL:  "We do that every year.  It has become our annual family tradition."<br />JEFF:  "That's a great tradition.  Does it get crowded there?"<br />BILL:  "Yes!  It gets very crowded, so we leave early and just hang out at the park all day."<br />JEFF:  "Is there parking available?"<br />BILL:  "Yes, but it is very limited."<br />JEFF:  "What time do you get there?"<br />BILL:  "We usually go around 4 pm.  The fireworks show starts around 6 pm."<br />JEFF:  "Do you take your dog?"<br />BILL:  "No.  He doesn't like loud noises.  It scares him.  A couple of years ago, he ran away during the fireworks show."<br />JEFF:  "That's terrible.  Poor dog."<br />BILL:  "So, now we leave him with my parents on the fourth of July.  Their neighborhood is very quiet."<br />JEFF:  "Your parents don't like fireworks?"<br />BILL:  "Not anymore.  They say it's too loud.  Their neighborhood does not allow fireworks."<br />JEFF:  "Why?"<br />BILL:  "They say it's too loud and dangerous."<br />JEFF:  "Oh, I understand.  That's why I watch the fireworks on TV."<br />BILL:  "That's a quiet and safe place to watch them."<br />

Have you made a New Year's resolution yet?"<br />JANE:  "What is that?"<br />HELEN:  "A goal you want to set or achieve in the New Year.

Another year, I was going to quit smoking.  There are too many to list."<br />JANE:  "If you can't achieve them, why do you make one every year?"<br />HELEN:  "I should at least try to achieve one goal."<br />JANE:  "Was there ever a successful resolution?"<br />HELEN:  "Let me think about it.  I don't think so."<br />JANE:  "Then your resolution for the New Year should be not to make any more resolutions."<br />HELEN:  "Great idea!"<br />

Thanksgiving Conversation
What is Thanksgiving?
SUE:  "Hi Anne."<br />ANNE:  "Hi Sue."<br />SUE:  "I have a question about Thanksgiving.  What does that day mean?"<br />ANNE:  "It's an American holiday that's celebrated once a year."<br />SUE:  "What is the date?"<br />ANNE:  "There is no actual date.  It is different every year.  It is on the fourth Thursday in November."<br />SUE:  "That's interesting.  Why do Americans celebrate this day?"<br />ANNE:  "It first started many years ago after the pilgrims settled in America.  They wanted to celebrate the first harvest after settling in America."<br />SUE:  "Oh, I see.  Is there anything special Americans do on that day like fireworks on the 4th of July?"<br />ANNE:  "We typically roast a whole turkey and make lots of other dishes like potatoes and stuffing."<br />SUE:  "Wow!  That sounds like a feast.  Can your family eat all of that?"<br />ANNE:  "We invite our relatives and celebrate this day together."<br />SUE:  "It's like a family reunion."<br />ANNE:  "It is!  And, pumpkin pie is usually the dessert because pumpkins are in season in the Fall."<br />SUE:  "It sounds like a nice tradition."<br />ANNE:  "Nowadays, many people celebrate this day to give thanks for all of their blessings like family and good health."<br />SUE:  "I like this tradition.  Maybe I will roast a turkey this year.  Will you teach me?"<br />ANNE:  "Sure.  I would love to.  I have many great recipes I can share with you."<br />

Labor Day
CATHY:  "Mom, why do people get Labor Day off?"<br />MOM:  "Well, Cathy.  It's the day we honor working Americans."<br />CATHY:  "So, we celebrate people that work?"<br />MOM:  "Yes. Back in the late 1800's, many Americans were working long hours under poor conditions.   People protested to have better working conditions and a special holiday was created for workers.  In 1894, Labor Day became a national holiday."<br />CATHY:  "So, people have a day off from work?"<br />MOM:  "Yes.  Many businesses close and companies let people take a day off.  Post offices and banks are closed."<br />CATHY:  "And, schools are closed, too?"<br />MOM:  "Yes.  Schools are not open on this day either."<br />CATHY:  "Is it always in September?"<br />MOM:  "Yes.  It's always the first Monday in September."<br />CATHY:  "Do we do anything special on this day?"<br />MOM:  "Well, now it's also celebrated as the end of summer."<br />CATHY:  "Is that why we always have a picnic and get together with family and friends?"<br />MOM:  "Yes.  Some places even have fireworks and parades."<br />CATHY:  "I'm glad there is a day to honor hard-working people."<br />MOM:  "Yes, Cathy.  One day you will also be a hard-working American."<br />

I'm taking my grandchildren to a butterfly conservatory today."<br />HELEN:  "What is that?"<br />JOAN:  "It's a place that displays butterflies and you can learn all about them."<br />HELEN:  "So, it's like a museum for butterflies?"<br />JOAN:  "Yes, but these butterflies are alive."<br />HELEN:  "They're alive?"<br />JOAN:  "Yes, they fly around the room and sometimes they even land on you.  A butterfly landed on my head once."<br />HELEN:  "That's so fun!"<br />JOAN:  "It is.  There are so many different kinds of butterflies too.  They're so beautiful.  Their colors and designs are spectacular."<br />HELEN:  "Your grandkids are going to enjoy it."<br />JOAN:  "I hope so."<br />HELEN:  "If I were a child, I would enjoy it."<br />JOAN:  "But times have changed.  Kids prefer to watch television and play video games these days."<br />HELEN:  "I understand.  How old are your grandchildren?"<br />JOAN:  "My granddaughter is 5 years old and my grandson is 7 years old."<br />HELEN:  "I think they're both at a good age to enjoy it."<br />JOAN:  "My granddaughter likes to draws butterflies and my grandson loves insects.  So, I thought they would love this."<br />HELEN:  "I think they will.  Don't worry about it so much.  Just go and have a good time."<br />JOAN:  "Ok.  I better go now."<br />HELEN:  "Have fun!"<br />

Natural Disasters Conversation
Heavy Rain and Flooding
TIM:  "Joe, where are you going in such a hurry?"<br />JOE:  "Didn't you hear?  The weather report is predicting heavy rain and severe flooding in our area."<br />TIM:  "No, I didn't hear that.  I haven't watched the news in a few days."<br />JOE:  "I'm heading to the store to buy sandbags."<br />TIM:  "Sandbags?  Why?"<br />JOE:  "To stop the water from entering my house.  You should do the same thing."<br />TIM:  "I think I'll just evacuate if that happens."<br />JOE:  "I can't do that.  I need to stay here with all of my animals."<br />TIM:  "You don't have any place to take them?"<br />JOE:  "No.  I need to make sure they are safe."<br />TIM:  "Do you need help loading the sandbags into your truck?"<br />JOE:  "That would be great.  Aren't you worried at all?"<br />TIM:  "I guess I should be.  But every time the weather person says something terrible is going to happen, it never does."<br />JOE:  "Well, I'm not risking it this time."<br />TIM:  "Now you have me worried."<br />JOE:  "You should be."<br />

Earthquake
JIM:  "Honey, are you ok?"<br />SUE:  "Yes, are you ok?"<br />JIM:  "Yeah.  I've never felt an earthquake before?"<br />SUE:  "Me too.  That was scary.  We've experience hurricanes, but never an earthquake."<br />JIM:  "I'm going to look around and see how bad the damage is."<br />SUE:  "Be careful.  There could be aftershocks."<br />JIM:  "I know.  Don't go outside.  The power is down.  There could be power lines on the ground."<br />SUE:  "Ok.  Where are the dogs?"<br />JIM:  "I found them.  They're both under the bed."<br />SUE:  "They must be scared."<br />JIM:  "I wish we could watch the news.  I want to know how much damage this earthquake caused."<br />SUE:  "Let me find the radio.  We can listen to the news."<br />JIM:  "I think it's in the garage."<br />SUE:  "Do we have any batteries for it?"<br />JIM:  "Yeah.  Let me get them."<br />SUE:  "I knew the big one was coming one day, but we weren't prepared."<br />JIM:  "Yeah, that was a big mistake."<br />SUE:  "We better pack an emergency kit for next time."<br />

Forest Fire
MARY:  "I just spoke with my mom.  She and my dad are devastated.  The fire is moving closer to their home."<br />BOB:  "What can they do?"<br />MARY:  "The firefighters say there is nothing they can do at this point.  They have to evacuate immediately."<br />BOB:  "That's horrible."<br />MARY:  "I know.  I wish I could help them, but we live in another state."<br />BOB:  "Where are they going to stay tonight?"<br />MARY:  "They're going to stay with my sister until they find another place to live."<br />BOB:  "Why don't they stay with us, too?  They can come here after things settle down."<br />MARY:  "That might be a good idea.  Maybe being away from there will help them forget about all of this."<br />BOB:  "Well, they will never forget.  But hopefully, they will be able to move on."<br />MARY:  "Bob, I'm so sad.  That was my childhood home.  I have so many memories of that place."<br />BOB:  "I'm sorry.  I know this must be very difficult for you and your parents."<br />MARY:  "Thanks.  My sister too.  She and I grew up in that house.  My parents lived there for forty years."<br />BOB:  "I can't believe a wildfire can destroy everything so quickly.  It's just terrible."<br />MARY:  "They're going to lose everything.  The firefighters gave them only a few hours to pack."<br />BOB:  "Is anyone helping them pack?"<br />MARY:  "Yeah, my sister is with them.  She's going to call me later tonight."<br />

Taking Care of Plants
ALICE:  "You take such good care of your plants, Joan."<br />JOAN:  "I try my best.  I love plants."<br />ALICE:  "I have killed every plant I have ever owned."<br />JOAN:  "How, Alice?"<br />ALICE:  "I don't know.  I water them and make sure they get enough sun, but they still die."<br />JOAN:  "That's strange."<br />ALICE:  "I know.  I don't buy plants anymore."<br />JOAN:  "That's sad.  Plants are beautiful and they provide oxygen too."<br />ALICE:  "Can you teach me how to care for plants?"<br />JOAN:  "Sure.  I'm going on vacation tomorrow.  I'll be gone for a couple of weeks.  We can start after I get back."<br />ALICE:  "Ok!  Can we shop for the plants together?"<br />JOAN:  "Yes.  Let's get a couple of plants that require low maintenance."<br />ALICE:  "What do you mean by low maintenance?"<br />JOAN:  "Plants that don't need much attention."<br />ALICE:  "That will be perfect for me."<br />JOAN:  "I'll make a list of good plants to start with."<br />ALICE:  "What are you going to do about all of your plants while you're on vacation?"<br />JOAN:  "Well, I was going to ask you to water them for me, but I think I'll ask my sister instead."<br />ALICE:  "Yeah, that's a good idea."<br />

They're beautiful."<br />CATHY:  "How many are there?"<br />SUSAN:  "I counted 30."<br />CATHY:  "Wow!  That must've been expensive."<br />SUSAN:  "I need to find a vase.  I don't want them to die."<br />CATHY:  "Is there one in the kitchen?"<br />SUSAN:  "I found one.  But it's too small."<br />CATHY:  "Yeah, that bouquet is huge.  You're a lucky woman.  I wish my boyfriend would send me flowers.  Is it a special occasion?"<br />SUSAN:  "No, not really."<br />CATHY:  "Do you know why he sent them?"<br />SUSAN:  "I have an idea."<br />CATHY:  "Why do you think he sent them?"<br />SUSAN:  "Well, he forgot my birthday yesterday."<br />CATHY:  "Oh!

Luckily, we weren't home at the time."<br />STAN:  "Yes, you are very lucky!"<br />MARK:  "I know.  It was the big tree in our yard."<br />STAN:  "I can't believe it.  Will insurance cover the repair costs?"<br />MARK:  "I hope so.  I'm waiting for the insurance guy to come right now."<br />STAN:  "What are you going to do?  DO you have a place to stay while your house gets fixed?"<br />MARK:  "Yeah, we're going to stay at my parents' house.  They don't live far from here."<br />STAN:  "That's good!"<br />MARK:  "I really liked that tree.  It was so big and beautiful.  And, now it's in my living room."<br />STAN:  "You're a strong man if you can joke about it."<br />MARK:  "Well, if I don't laugh, I'll cry."<br />STAN:  "I would be crying right now."<br />MARK:  "Believe me, Stan.

A Beautiful Night
JANICE:  "Hi Sarah.  What are you doing outside so late at night?"<br />SARAH:  "Oh hi Janice.  I couldn't sleep.  What are you doing here?"<br />JANICE:  "I come out here once in a while to look at the stars.  Aren't they beautiful?"<br />SARAH:  "Yes, they are.  I never really paid attention to them."<br />JANICE:  "You're lucky tonight.  The sky is clear, so the stars are very bright."<br />SARAH:  "We have a telescope, but we never use it.  I may need to bring it outside one day."<br />JANICE:  "That's awesome.  I wish we had one."<br />SARAH:  "You can borrow ours."<br />JANICE:  "That would be great!  I've always been interested in astronomy."<br />SARAH:  "What's that?"<br />JANICE:  "Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and other objects in outer space."<br />SARAH:  "That would be really interesting to study."<br />JANICE:  "Yeah.  I took a college class in astronomy once.  It was fascinating."<br />SARAH:  "Look at the moon!  It's a full moon."<br />JANICE:  "Yeah, didn't you see it earlier tonight?"<br />SARAH:  "No.  I didn't notice it earlier.  What a beautiful sight."<br />JANICE:  "It's supposed to be clear tomorrow night too.  Do you want to meet out here again?"<br />SARAH:  "Sure.  How about 11 pm?"<br />JANICE:  "I'll be here."<br />SARAH:  "I'll bring my telescope."<br />

Solar System Project
JOE:  "Hi Carol.  What are you looking for?"<br />CAROL:  "Oh hi Joe.  I'm looking for some materials to make a solar system."<br />JOE:  "A solar system?"<br />CAROL:  "Yeah, David has a science project.  He has to make a model of the solar system with the sun and the planets."<br />JOE:  "How about some balls?  They can represent the planets and the sun."<br />CAROL:  "I was looking for some foam balls, but I can't find any in our garage."<br />JOE:  "I might have some.  Judy had to make a solar system model a few years ago.  I might have some balls left over."<br />CAROL:  "That would be great! David wants to paint them and glue them on a black poster board."<br />JOE:  "That's what Judy did too."<br />CAROL:  "Was Judy in Mrs. Johnson's science class?"<br />JOE:  "Yes!"<br />CAROL:  "She must have the students do the same project every year."<br />JOE:  "It's a great project.  We had a fun time doing it together."<br />CAROL:  "Are there eight or nine planets now?  When I was a child, Pluto was a planet.  But it's not considered a major planet anymore."<br />JOE:  "I know.  I think scientists are still debating that issue.  David should ask his teacher."<br />CAROL:  "Good idea."<br />JOE:  "Let me go look for the balls.  I think I still have her model in the garage too.  I'll be right back."<br />CAROL:  "Thank you! I'll keep looking in my garage too."<br />

That's an old tale."<br />TOM:  "You don't believe it?"<br />SALLY:  "No, absolutely not."<br />TOM:  "Do you believe in werewolves?"<br />SALLY:  "What are werewolves?"<br />TOM:  "Creatures that are half human, half wolf.  They come out when there's a full moon."<br />SALLY:  "Now you are being ridiculous.  I'm going to look for the brightest star."<br />TOM:  "Why?"<br />SALLY:  "If you see the brightest star, you can make a wish and it will come true."<br />TOM:  "Now you're being ridiculous."<br />SALLY:  "I'm going to wish that we stop this conversation."<br />TOM:  "What if you see a werewolf tonight."<br />SALLY:  "You've been watching too many horror movies."<br />

No matter how hard I try, everything dies."<br />JOAN:  "Are you using a good fertilizer?"<br />CAROL:  "I think so.  I also water my flowers regularly and trim any dead leaves."<br />JOAN:  "You're doing all of the right things."<br />CAROL:  "I don't know what's wrong."<br />JOAN:  "Maybe you don't have a green thumb."<br />CAROL:  "What is a green thumb?"<br />JOAN:  "A green thumb means you have good gardening skills."<br />CAROL:  "Oh.  Then I definitely do not have a green thumb."<br />JOAN:  "My dad used to love gardening.  I learned everything from him."<br />CAROL:  "Can you teach me?"<br />JOAN:  "Sure.

I'm growing more vegetables this year."<br />CAROL:  "What are you growing?"<br />JOAN:  "Zucchinis and lettuce."<br />CAROL:  "That's amazing!  You won't have to buy any more vegetables at the market."<br />JOAN:  "I know.  I'll let you know when the zucchinis and lettuce are ready."<br />CAROL:  "Thank you.  You're so generous."<br />JOAN:  "Well, you always make me apple pies with apples from your apple tree."<br />CAROL:  "I will make you more in exchange for the vegetables."<br />JOAN:  "That's a deal!"<br />CAROL:  "Have you thought about selling your vegetables at the local farmer's market?"<br />JOAN:  "No.  I like giving them to my family and friends."<br />CAROL:  "That's nice of you."<br />JOAN:  "I live alone, so I can't eat all of the vegetables by myself."<br />

What do you need done?"<br />MRS. BAILEY:  "How about mowing and watering the lawn?"<br />TOMMY:  "I can do both of those things."<br />MRS. BAILEY:  "Bill and I are getting too old to do it.

Any ideas about the materials?"<br />KEVIN:  "I'm not sure.  I was thinking about using cardboard boxes."<br />DAD:  "That's a great idea.  We have a lot of old boxes.  I saved them after we moved here."<br />KEVIN:  "Where are they?"<br />DAD:  "They're in the garage.  Help me bring them into the house."<br />KEVIN:  "Ok.  Where should we put them?"<br />DAD:  "Let's put them in the living room.  It's the biggest room in the house.  There's plenty of space to make a mess."<br />KEVIN:  "Mom isn't going to be happy with all the mess."<br />DAD:  "That's ok.  She can help us too."<br />KEVIN:  "Ok.  What should I do first?"<br />DAD:  "Why don't you design the building and then we can create it."<br />KEVIN:  "That's a good plan.  Thanks for your help, Dad."<br />DAD:  "It's my pleasure.  I'm an architect.  Building is my specialty."<br />

The museum is a great place too.  You can learn a lot there."<br />CHARLIE:  "I know.  But I want to see animals."<br />DAD:  "Ok.  It's your choice.  The museum is having a display of old airplanes."<br />CHARLIE:  "Airplanes?  I really like airplanes too."<br />DAD:  "You have a tough decision."<br />CHARLIE:  "Now I can't decide.  I need to really think about it."<br />

I just got my report card."<br />JOAN:  "Is it that bad?"<br />CATHY:  "I was hoping to get a good grade in Science class, but I didn't."<br />JOAN:  "That's a hard class."<br />CATHY:  "I know.  I did well in all of my other classes, but that one."<br />JOAN:  "You should think about the good grades you received.  Don't worry about one class."<br />CATHY:  "I know.  But I want to be a scientist.  So, this is discouraging to me."<br />JOAN:  "Just study harder next time.  You can do it."<br />CATHY:  "Thanks for your encouragement.  How did you do?"<br />JOAN:  "I did well.  I was most worried about math."<br />CATHY:  "How did you do in your math class?"<br />JOAN:  "Better than I expected.  But not a perfect grade."<br />CATHY:  "How about science?"<br />JOAN:  "Oh, I did ok."<br />CATHY:  "What does ok mean?"<br />JOAN:  "I did really well."<br />CATHY:  "I'm happy for you.

I hope I have enough time."<br />ALAN:  "Well, I guess it's not supposed to be easy since it's extra credit."<br />GREG:  "Yeah, you're right.  I better stop talking and start reading."<br />

I need to replace it."<br />DIANE:  "Have you tried to repair it?"<br />KATE:  "Yeah, we called a repairman yesterday.  He said that it would cost more to repair than to replace it."<br />DIANE:  "Wow.  At least he was honest about it."<br />KATE:  "I know.  I appreciated that.  We really can't afford to buy a new one right now.  We just had a baby a couple of months ago.  But I really need one."<br />DIANE:  "That's right.  You had a baby not too long ago.  Why don't you buy a used one?"<br />KATE:  "Where can I get a used one that's in good condition?"<br />DIANE:  "I actually have a friend who is selling hers.  She said there isn't anything wrong with her current one.  She just wants a different color.  Her current one is white."<br />KATE:  "I don't care what color it is.  I just want one that works well.  Do you know how much it is?"<br />DIANE:  "I don't know.  Let me call her right now."<br />KATE:  "Thanks.  I'll talk to my husband too.  He may not want a used one.  He's a little picky about appliances."<br />DIANE:  "Ok.  Let me know if he's interested."<br />

Needing a New Refrigerator
LINDA:  "Something is wrong with my refrigerator."<br />SUE:  "What's wrong with it?"<br />LINDA:  "It's not staying cold."<br />SUE:  "That could be a big problem."<br />LINDA:  "I know.  I'm worried that my food is going to spoil.  I just went grocery shopping yesterday."<br />SUE:  "I have room in my second refrigerator if you need to store some things."<br />LINDA:  "You have two refrigerators?"<br />SUE:  "Yeah.  We needed two refrigerators because I cook a lot.  There was a big sale at the appliance store, so we bought another one last week."<br />LINDA:  "Is the sale still going on?  I may need to buy a new one."<br />SUE:  "Today is the last day of the sale."<br />LINDA:  "Then I better tell my husband.  We need to go today."<br />SUE:  "Isn't your husband a great repairman.  Maybe he can fix your refrigerator."<br />LINDA:  "It's getting old.  I'd rather buy a new one."<br />SUE:  "If your husband can fix your broken one, you can have two refrigerators like me."<br />LINDA:  "I don't cook that much."<br />

New Appliance Store
JOAN:  "Hi Carol.  There's a new appliance store opening downtown today.  Have you seen the flyer for the grand opening?"<br />CAROL:  "Hi Joan.  Yeah, I was thinking about checking it out."<br />JOAN:  "Do you want to go together?"<br />CAROL:  "Sure.  I don't need a new appliance, but I would love to update my washer and dryer one day."<br />JOAN:  "I just bought a new washer and dryer set.  I love it!"<br />CAROL:  "I'm jealous.  My set is really old.  It takes a long time to wash and dry."<br />JOAN:  "You should really look into upgrading your set.  It can save you money?"<br />CAROL:  "How can it save me money?"<br />JOAN:  "The new washers use less water and the dryers uses less energy."<br />CAROL:  "Really?  Maybe it's time for an upgrade."<br />JOAN:  "I can show you what I bought."<br />CAROL:  "That would great!  Maybe it will be on sale."<br />JOAN:  "I wish I knew about the new store when I bought my set.  I paid full price for mine."<br />CAROL:  "You didn't buy it on sale?"<br />JOAN:  "No, I was foolish."<br />CAROL:  "I'm not jealous anymore."<br />JOAN:  "Let's go check out the new store."<br />

How old is it?"<br />MIKE:  "Several years old.  It was a high school graduation gift from my parents."<br />GARY:  "Yeah, it's probably time to replace it."<br />MIKE:  "I don't know what to buy.  There are so many different models these days."<br />GARY:  "You should go to a computer store and ask about the different kinds?"<br />MIKE:  "That's a good idea.  Do you want to go with me?"<br />GARY:  "When?  I have to work today.  Can you wait until tomorrow?"<br />MIKE:  "Sure.  I have to work until 5 pm tomorrow.

My son keeps taking mine.  I'm tired of sharing it with him all the time."<br />TOM:  "Is that why you are helping him buy one?"<br />MARK:  "Yes.  Do you have one?"<br />TOM:  "Yeah.

I always see people selling their dining room furniture at yard sales."<br />KAREN:  "That's a great idea!  Maybe if the furniture looks really old, I can get a good deal.  I can just paint them."<br />MOM:  "Right!  We should go today."<br />KAREN:  "Yes!  I'm excited to see what I can find."<br />MOM:  "Maybe I'll find something too."<br />

It will be my treat since you're having a bad day."<br />CAROL:  "Thanks!  That's so nice of you."<br />JANE:  "My pleasure.  Let's go check out the phone store."<br />

When I'm not at work, I'm spending time with my family.  Life is so busy these days for many people."<br />LISA:  "That's true.

He understands that health is very important."<br />PHIL:  "Ok.  I will talk to him today.  Thanks for your advice."<br />KAREN:  "You're welcome.  Where do you plan to go on vacation?"<br />PHIL:  "A nice, warm beach."<br />KAREN:  "That sounds great!"<br />

Busy at Work Conversation
Big Project
PETER:  "Hey Tom.  Are you working late again?"<br />TOM:  "Yeah, Peter.  I have a big project I'm working on."<br />PETER:  "How's it going?"<br />TOM:  "Not well.  We keep running into problems with the client."<br />PETER:  "What kind of problems."<br />TOM:  "The client either doesn't like our designs or keeps changing his mind.  It's very frustrating."<br />PETER:  "That can be very annoying."<br />TOM:  "It is.  So, my group has to start over each time.  It's such a waste of time and money."<br />PETER:  "When is the deadline?"<br />TOM:  "In two weeks.  I don't know how we're going to make it."<br />PETER:  "Where's the rest of your group?"<br />TOM:  "They went to eat.  I told them to go.  They're going to bring me back some dinner."<br />PETER:  "That's good.  What are you going to do after your deadline is over?"<br />TOM:  "Go on a long vacation."<br />PETER:  "Good for you!"<br />TOM:  "Well, I better get back to work.  See you in the morning."<br />

I have too many things to do."<br />JIM:  "What do you have to do?"<br />TED:  "I have a big presentation due soon."<br />JIM:  "What are you going to do?"<br />TED:  "I don't know.  The airline tickets are non-refundable and my family is going to be very sad."<br />JIM:  "Is there any way you can finish everything before your trip?"<br />TED:  "That's what I'm trying to do, but I don't know if I can."<br />JIM:  "Is there anyone at work who can help you?"<br />TED:  "Yeah, but he's been sick."<br />JIM:  "Oh.  That's terrible.  Why don't you talk to your boss?"<br />TED:  "He's not very understanding.  He just wants the work to be completed."<br />JIM:  "Maybe you can take work with you on your trip."<br />TED:  "That's not a vacation.  But I may have to do that.  My wife is not going to be happy."<br />JIM:  "I wish I could help you."<br />TED:  "Thanks.  Do you know anything about presentations?"<br />JIM:  "No, I'm an accountant."<br />

Losing a Job
BILL:  "Hey Matt, you're home early today."<br />MATT:  "Oh, hi Bill.  I got laid off today."<br />BILL:  "I'm sorry to hear that.  Why?"<br />MATT:  "The company is downsizing and they eliminated my position."<br />BILL:  "That's terrible.  How long did you work there?"<br />MATT:  "15 years."<br />BILL:  "Wow!  That's a long time."<br />MATT:  "I know.  I worked very hard, but I guess it wasn't enough."<br />BILL:  "Don't say that.  Companies usually downsize because they are losing money."<br />MATT:  "I know.  I just don't know what to do now.  I have a family to take care of."<br />BILL:  "Does your wife know?"<br />MATT:  "Not yet.  She's at work.  I didn't want to give her bad news there."<br />BILL:  "I understand.  What kind of work did you do?"<br />MATT:  "I'm a graphic designer."<br />BILL:  "Really?  My son is a website developer.  Do you know anything about web design?"<br />MATT:  "That's my specialty."<br />BILL:  "Let me give him a call.  Maybe he can help you find a job."<br />MATT:  "That would be great!  I really appreciate it."<br />

Company Downsizing Rumors
JASON:  "Hey Joe, did you hear the rumors?"<br />JOE:  "No, Jason.  What rumors?"<br />JASON:  "The company is laying people off?"<br />JOE:  "When?"<br />JASON:  "I'm not sure.  I heard this from Susan in Accounting."<br />JOE:  "Why are they laying people off?"<br />JASON:  "The company is not making a profit."<br />JOE:  "Are you worried?"<br />JASON:  "Yeah.  I'm very worried.  I just bought a house."<br />JOE:  "I'm really worried too.  My wife and I just had a baby.  Also, I haven't been at this company for very long.  I would be the first one to get laid off."<br />JASON:  "This is terrible.  What should we do?"<br />JOE:  "Maybe we should start looking for other jobs."<br />JASON:  "But what if it's all a rumor and not true."<br />JOE:  "Well, if you heard it from Susan, it must be true."<br />JASON:  "Why?"<br />JOE:  "Her mom is our boss."<br />

Looking for a job Conversation
Job Search

I've sent out over 30 resumes and no one has called me."<br />SEAN:  "I think a lot of people are looking for jobs right now.  The economy isn't very good, so companies aren't hiring people."<br />RICK:  "That's what it seems like.  But I need a job."<br />SEAN:  "How long have you been out of work?"<br />RICK:  "3 months."<br />SEAN:  "What kind of work do you do?"<br />RICK:  "I'm an electrician."<br />SEAN:  "Have you thought about opening your own business?"<br />RICK:  "Yeah, but that takes money."<br />SEAN:  "I understand.  If I hear anyone looking for an electrician, I'll let you know."<br />RICK:  "Thanks.  It's been frustrating."<br />SEAN:  "Why did you leave your last job?"<br />RICK:  "I didn't get along with my boss."<br />SEAN:  "Maybe you should've stayed until you found another job."<br />RICK:  "Yeah.  That was my mistake.  I thought it would be easy to find another job.  I was wrong."<br />SEAN:  "Don't worry.  You'll find one soon.  Come on, let me buy you a cup of coffee."<br />RICK:  "Thanks."<br />

I'm applying for a teller position."<br />SALLY:  "But why do you look so nervous?"<br />JANE:  "Because I don't have much work experience, but I'm a hard worker and good with numbers."<br />SALLY:  "Tell them that."<br />JANE:  "I'm going to.  I just hope I don't mess up."<br />SALLY:  "Don't worry so much.  You're smart and you get along well with everyone."<br />JANE:  "Thanks.  I'm just afraid that I won't be able to answer their questions."<br />SALLY:  "Just answer them the best you can.  Be confident."<br />JANE:  "Ok.  I just need to relax."<br />SALLY:  "What time is your interview?"<br />JANE:  "In an hour.  I better leave soon.  I don't want to be late."<br />SALLY:  "Yeah, don't be late.  That would be a bad first impression."<br />JANE:  "You're right.  Thanks for your advice and encouragement.  I feel much better."<br />SALLY:  "Good.  Now go!"<br />
